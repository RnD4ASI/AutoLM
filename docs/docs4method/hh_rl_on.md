Below is the **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** for implementing a context-aware hyper-heuristic using **online reinforcement learning (RL)** for optimizing the sequencing and selection of components in a Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline. This SOP is designed for an online learning RL approach, where the agent interacts with the environment in real-time to explore and optimize configurations based on task complexity, contrasting with offline RL which relies on a fixed dataset.

## SOP: Implementing Context-Aware Online RL in Hyper-Heuristic for LLM Pipeline Sequencing and Selection

### Objective
To develop a context-aware hyper-heuristic using online reinforcement learning that dynamically selects and sequences LLM pipeline components (e.g., language model, scaling strategy, prompt optimization, hyperparameters) based on task complexity. The agent optimizes performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, BLEU score) through real-time interaction, exploration, and learning, ensuring adaptability across diverse tasks.

---

### Step 1: Define the Contextual State Space
- **Purpose:** Represent the current state of the pipeline configuration and task context to guide adaptive decision-making.
- **Implementation:**
  - **State Components:**
    - **Current Selections:** Track selected components (e.g., Model = GPT-3, Scaling = None).
    - **Step Number:** Indicate the current position in the sequence (e.g., Step = 2 out of 4).
    - **Contextual Features:** Encode task complexity as:
      - Categorical (e.g., Simple, Medium, Complex).
      - Continuous (e.g., a complexity score from 0 to 1 based on task attributes like input length or reasoning depth).
  - **Example State (Step 1):**
    - \( S_1 = \{ \text{Model = GPT-3, Scaling = None, Prompt = None, Hyperparams = None, Task = Complex, Step = 1} \} \)

---

### Step 2: Define the Action Space
- **Purpose:** Specify the decisions the RL agent can make at each step to construct the pipeline.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Action Definition:** At each step, the agent chooses:
    - **Which component** to configure next from the remaining unselected components (e.g., "scaling strategy").
    - **Which option** for that component (e.g., "Best-of-5").
  - **Example Action:**
    - From \( S_1 \), action = "Select Scaling = Best-of-5".
  - **Constraint:** Each component is selected exactly once, reducing the action space progressively.

---

### Step 3: Specify the Reward Function
- **Purpose:** Provide feedback to the RL agent based on the performance of the completed pipeline.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Sparse Reward:** Assign a reward only after all components are selected (e.g., after Step 4), based on a performance metric like accuracy or BLEU score.
  - **Reward Example:**
    - Sequence: GPT-3 → Chain-of-Thought (CoT) → Best-of-5 → Temp=0.7 → Reward = 0.90.
  - **Note:** The agent must effectively handle delayed rewards due to the sparse reward structure.

---

### Step 4: Initialize the Policy
- **Purpose:** Establish an initial policy to guide early exploration in the online setting.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Options:**
    - **Random Policy:** Select actions randomly to explore the space initially.
    - **Pre-trained Policy:** Use a policy trained on a similar task or a small offline dataset.
    - **Heuristic Policy:** Leverage domain knowledge (e.g., prioritize selecting the model first).
  - **Example:** Start with a policy that selects components in a fixed order but with random options.

---

### Step 5: Choose an Online RL Algorithm
- **Purpose:** Select an algorithm suited for real-time learning and exploration.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Algorithm:** Deep Q-Network (DQN) with ε-greedy exploration
    - **Reason:** DQN excels in discrete action spaces and can manage the combinatorial complexity of the pipeline.
  - **Exploration Strategy:** Begin with a high ε (e.g., 0.9) for broad exploration, decaying over time to exploit learned strategies.
  - **Alternative Algorithms:** Consider Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for continuous action spaces or more stable learning.

---

### Step 6: Design the Policy Network
- **Purpose:** Build a neural network to approximate the Q-function or policy.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Input:** State vector, including:
    - One-hot or embedded representations of selected components.
    - Step number (scalar).
    - Contextual features (e.g., task complexity score).
  - **Output:** Q-values for each possible action or a probability distribution over actions.
  - **Architecture:** Use a deep neural network (e.g., multi-layer perceptron or transformer) to model interactions between selections and context.

---

### Step 7: Implement the Online Learning Loop
- **Purpose:** Enable the agent to interact with the environment, collect data, and refine its policy in real-time.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Loop Structure:**
    1. **Initialize Episode:** Set the initial state \( S_0 \) with the task context.
    2. **Select Action:** Choose an action using the current policy (with exploration).
    3. **Execute Action:** Update the state based on the selected action.
    4. **Receive Reward:** After Step 4, evaluate the pipeline and receive the reward.
    5. **Store Transition:** Save the transition (state, action, reward, next_state) in a replay buffer.
    6. **Update Policy:** Periodically sample from the replay buffer and update the Q-network using gradient descent.
    7. **Repeat:** Continue until convergence or a maximum number of episodes.
  - **Example:**
    - Episode 1: Randomly select GPT-3 → Self-Consistency (SC) → Best-of-3 → Temp=0.7 for Task=Simple → Reward=0.95.
    - Episode 2: Try LLaMA → CoT → Best-of-5 → Temp=1.0 for Task=Complex → Reward=0.80.
    - Update Q-values after each episode.

---

### Step 8: Manage Exploration vs. Exploitation
- **Purpose:** Balance exploration of new configurations with exploitation of known effective ones.
- **Implementation:**
  - **ε-Greedy Decay:** Start with ε=0.9, decay by 0.995 per episode to a minimum of 0.05.
  - **Alternative:** Use Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or entropy-based exploration for more nuanced strategies.
  - **Monitoring:** Track performance over time to ensure exploration remains effective.

---

### Step 9: Evaluate and Refine
- **Purpose:** Assess the agent’s performance and enhance its generalization.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Evaluation:**
    - Periodically test the policy on benchmark tasks with known optimal configurations.
    - Measure adaptability to different contexts.
  - **Refinement:**
    - Adjust exploration rate or algorithm parameters if convergence is slow.
    - Incorporate transfer learning from related tasks to accelerate learning.

---

### Step 10: Deploy the Hyper-Heuristic
- **Purpose:** Integrate the trained RL agent into the LLM pipeline configuration process.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Input:** Task context (e.g., task complexity = Complex).
  - **Process:**
    - Initialize \( S_0 \) with the context and no selections.
    - At each step, select the action with the highest Q-value (exploit).
    - Continue until all components are configured (e.g., GPT-3 → CoT → Best-of-5 → Temp=0.7).
  - **Output:** A fully specified, context-adapted LLM pipeline.

---

### Step 11: Continual Learning
- **Purpose:** Ensure long-term effectiveness as new tasks or components emerge.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Continual Exploration:** Maintain a small ε to allow ongoing exploration.
  - **Update Policy:** Regularly update the policy with new experiences.
  - **Adaptation:** Expand the action space for new components or contexts and retrain as needed.

---

## Key Considerations for Online RL
- **Computational Cost:** Running LLMs for each episode is resource-intensive; consider batching evaluations or using simulations to reduce costs.
- **Exploration Risk:** Suboptimal configurations during exploration may degrade performance; mitigate with reward shaping or constrained exploration.
- **Context Encoding:** Accurately represent context (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical features or normalization for continuous scores) to ensure effective adaptation.

---

## Differences from Offline RL
- **Data Collection:** Unlike offline RL, which uses a fixed dataset, online RL collects data through real-time interaction, enabling discovery of novel strategies.
- **Exploration:** Online RL actively explores the environment, while offline RL relies on pre-collected data, limiting its adaptability.
- **Risk and Cost:** Online RL’s exploration introduces higher computational and performance risks compared to the safer offline approach.
