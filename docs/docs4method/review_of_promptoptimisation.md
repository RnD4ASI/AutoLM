To address the user's query, I will analyze the two provided documents: *"Automatic Prompt Optimization via Heuristic Search: A Survey"* (Document 1) and *"A Systematic Survey of Automatic Prompt Optimization Techniques"* (Document 2). The task involves (1) constructing a consolidated tree for categorizing prompt optimization approaches, (2) itemizing every prompt optimization approach with descriptions, and (3) classifying each approach within the tree. The final response will be presented in a tabular format, ensuring traceability and accuracy based on the source documents.

### Step 1: Constructing a Consolidated Tree for Categorizing Prompt Optimization Approaches

Both documents provide taxonomies for automatic prompt optimization (APO), focusing on different dimensions. Document 1 organizes methods along five dimensions: **Where Optimization Happens**, **What is Optimized**, **What Criteria to Optimize**, **Which Operators are Used**, and **Which Iterative Algorithm is Used**. Document 2 proposes a 5-part framework: **Seed Prompts**, **Inference Evaluation and Feedback**, **Candidate Prompt Generation**, **Filter and Retain Promising Prompts**, and **Iteration Depth**. To create a consolidated tree, I will integrate overlapping concepts and ensure all key categories are represented, focusing on the optimization approach itself.
