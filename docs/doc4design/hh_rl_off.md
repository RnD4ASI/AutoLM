Below is a **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** for implementing a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Hyper-Heuristic with context awareness to optimize the sequencing and selection of components in a Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline. The goal is to dynamically configure components—such as the language model, test-time scaling strategy, prompt optimization paradigm, and hyperparameter values—based on contextual factors like task complexity, using offline RL to ensure adaptability and performance optimization.

## SOP: Implementing Context-Aware RL in Hyper-Heuristic for LLM Pipeline Sequencing and Selection

### Objective
To develop a context-aware hyper-heuristic using offline reinforcement learning that selects and sequences LLM pipeline components (e.g., language model, scaling strategy, prompt optimization, hyperparameters) based on task complexity, optimizing performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, BLEU score) while generalizing across diverse tasks.

---

### Step 1: Define the Contextual State Space
- **Purpose:** Represent the current state of the pipeline configuration and the task context to enable adaptive decision-making.
- **Implementation:**
  - **State Components:**
    - **Current Selections:** Track which components have been chosen (e.g., Model = GPT-3, Scaling = None).
    - **Step Number:** Indicate the current position in the sequence (e.g., Step = 2 out of 4).
    - **Contextual Features:** Include task complexity, encoded as:
      - Categorical (e.g., Simple, Medium, Complex).
      - Continuous (e.g., a complexity score from 0 to 1, based on task attributes like input length or reasoning depth).
  - **Example State (Step 1):**
    - \( S_1 = \{ \text{Model = GPT-3, Scaling = None, Prompt = None, Hyperparams = None, Task = Complex, Step = 1} \} \)

---

### Step 2: Define the Action Space
- **Purpose:** Specify the decisions the RL agent can make at each step to build the pipeline.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Action Definition:** At each step, the agent selects:
    - **Which component** to configure next from the remaining unselected components (e.g., "scaling strategy").
    - **Which option** for that component (e.g., "Best-of-5").
  - **Example Action:**
    - From \( S_1 \), action = "Select Scaling = Best-of-5".
  - **Constraint:** Each component is selected exactly once, reducing the action space as steps progress.

---

### Step 3: Specify the Reward Function
- **Purpose:** Provide feedback to the RL agent based on the performance of the final pipeline configuration.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Sparse Reward:** Assign a reward only after all components are selected (e.g., after Step 4), based on a performance metric like accuracy or BLEU score.
  - **Reward Example:**
    - Sequence: GPT-3 → Chain-of-Thought (CoT) → Best-of-5 → Temp=0.7 → Reward = 0.90.
  - **Note:** The sparse reward setup requires an RL algorithm capable of handling delayed feedback.

---

### Step 4: Collect or Generate a Dataset
- **Purpose:** Provide offline data for training the RL agent without real-time interaction.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Dataset Requirements:**
    - Sequences of component selections with final performance outcomes.
    - Contextual information (e.g., task complexity) for each sequence.
    - Diversity across contexts and sequences for robust learning.
  - **Example Trials:**
    1. Task = Simple: GPT-3 → Self-Consistency (SC) → Best-of-3 → Temp=0.7 → Reward = 0.95
    2. Task = Complex: GPT-3 → CoT → Best-of-5 → Temp=0.7 → Reward = 0.90
    3. Task = Simple: LLaMA → CoT → Best-of-5 → Temp=1.0 → Reward = 0.80
    4. Task = Complex: LLaMA → SC → Best-of-3 → Temp=1.0 → Reward = 0.75
  - **Format:** Store as (state, action, reward, next_state) tuples, with context embedded in the state.

---

### Step 5: Choose an Offline RL Algorithm
- **Purpose:** Select an algorithm optimized for learning from static data.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Algorithm:** Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)
    - **Reason:** CQL prevents overestimation of Q-values for unseen actions, making it ideal for offline RL with limited data.
  - **Benefit:** Ensures robust learning despite the combinatorial complexity of the pipeline and sparse dataset coverage.

---

### Step 6: Design the Policy Network
- **Purpose:** Create a neural network to approximate the Q-function, mapping states to action values.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Input:** State vector, including:
    - One-hot or embedded representations of selected components.
    - Step number (scalar).
    - Contextual features (e.g., task complexity score).
  - **Output:** Q-values for each possible action (e.g., Q-value for "Select Scaling = Best-of-5").
  - **Architecture:** Use a deep neural network (e.g., multi-layer perceptron or transformer) to capture interactions between selections and context.
  - **Example Input (Step 1):**
    - [Model=GPT-3, Scaling=None, Prompt=None, Hyperparams=None, Task=Complex, Step=1]

---

### Step 7: Train the RL Agent
- **Purpose:** Train the Q-network using the offline dataset to predict optimal actions.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Training Process:**
    - Apply CQL to minimize Q-value prediction errors while penalizing overconfidence in unseen actions.
    - Propagate sparse rewards back through the sequence using the Q-function.
  - **Techniques:**
    - Use experience replay to sample past transitions efficiently.
    - Apply regularization to prevent overfitting to the dataset.
  - **Validation:** Split the dataset into training and validation sets to monitor learning progress.

---

### Step 8: Evaluate and Refine
- **Purpose:** Assess the agent's performance and improve its generalization.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Evaluation:**
    - Test the policy on a validation set of contexts and sequences.
    - Measure performance against known high-performing configurations.
  - **Refinement:**
    - Augment the dataset with additional trials if certain contexts or sequences are underrepresented.
    - Adjust network architecture or hyperparameters if generalization is poor.

---

### Step 9: Deploy the Hyper-Heuristic
- **Purpose:** Integrate the trained RL agent into the LLM pipeline configuration process.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Input:** Task context (e.g., task complexity = Complex).
  - **Process:**
    - Initialize \( S_0 \) with the context and no selections.
    - At each step, select the action with the highest Q-value.
    - Continue until all components are configured (e.g., GPT-3 → CoT → Best-of-5 → Temp=0.7).
  - **Output:** A fully specified, context-adapted LLM pipeline.

---

### Step 10: Monitor and Update
- **Purpose:** Maintain effectiveness as new tasks or components arise.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Monitoring:** Log the performance of deployed configurations on real tasks.
  - **Updating:**
    - Periodically collect new trial data.
    - Retrain the agent to incorporate new contexts or component options.
  - **Optional:** Transition to online RL or fine-tuning if real-time interaction becomes feasible.

---

## Key Considerations for Context-Awareness
- **Context Encoding:** Use one-hot encoding for categorical contexts (e.g., Simple/Complex) or normalization for continuous scores (e.g., 0-1 scale).
- **Dataset Diversity:** Ensure the dataset spans a wide range of task complexities and component combinations to support generalization.
- **Generalization:** The agent should interpolate between contexts (e.g., Medium complexity) by learning patterns from Simple and Complex tasks.

---

## Alignment with Hyper-Heuristic Principles
- **Hyper-Heuristic Role:** The RL agent acts as a high-level controller, choosing which low-level heuristic (component selection) to apply next based on the state and context.
- **Context-Awareness:** Embedding task complexity allows the agent to adapt its strategy, akin to human decision-making.
- **No Free Lunch Theorem:** By tailoring selections to specific contexts, the approach avoids a one-size-fits-all solution, optimizing performance for each task type.
