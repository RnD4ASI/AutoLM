# 14-Day Development Plan for the Knowledge Retrieval and Task Execution Framework

After analyzing the provided Python scripts and the product description, I've developed a comprehensive 14-day plan to implement the outstanding work. This plan follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework with considerations for development, testing, integration, and optimization.

## Day 1-2: Project Setup and Design Refinement

### Day 1: Project Architecture and Configuration Design
- Create project structure with all necessary directories (config, db, src, tests)
- Develop configuration schemas for:
  - `task_prompt_library.json`: Define schema for task prompt definitions
  - `pm.json`: Project management configuration for task planning
  - `executor_config.json`: Task execution workflow configuration
  - `mle.json`: Machine learning engineering configuration (models, parameters, topologies)
- Set up version control and documentation
- Define interfaces between components

### Day 2: Knowledge Base Design and Data Modeling
- Design the database schemas for:
  - Vector databases (embeddings)
  - Graph databases (entity relationships)
  - Memory database (retrieval cache)
- Define data flows between components
- Create data validation schemas
- Plan test data generation

## Day 3-4: Task Planning and Configuration Implementation

### Day 3: Planner Implementation (TODO 2)
- Create `planner.py` module
- Implement task selection logic based on ultimate goals
- Develop sequence prediction algorithm for task ordering
- Create workflow configuration generator

### Day 4: Configuration Loading and Testing
- Implement configuration loading utilities
- Create sample configurations for testing
- Develop unit tests for configuration validation
- Implement logging and error handling for configuration issues

## Day 5-7: Core Module Implementation

### Day 5: Information Retrieval Implementation (TODO 3)
- Extend `retriever.py` with schema-based retrieval capabilities
- Implement Memory object management system
- Integrate with vector and graph databases from `dbbuilder.py`
- Develop common information schema generator

### Day 6: Task Executor Implementation (TODO 4)
- Create `executor.py` module
- Implement task-specific parameter selection logic
- Develop information sufficiency assessment algorithm
- Create model and topology selection system

### Day 7: Core Integration and Testing
- Integrate retriever, executor, and topologist modules
- Develop integration tests for core workflow
- Create logging system for runtime decisions
- Implement error recovery strategies

## Day 8-9: Evaluation and Output Implementation

### Day 8: Evaluation Implementation (TODO 5)
- Extend `evaluator.py` with task-specific evaluation metrics
- Implement retrieval performance assessment
- Develop response quality evaluation algorithms
- Create evaluation reporting system

### Day 9: Output Collation Implementation (TODO 6)
- Create `publisher.py` module
- Implement output formatting based on task requirements
- Develop Confluence integration for documentation publishing
- Create visualization components for results

## Day 10-12: Optimization Implementation

### Day 10: Planning Optimization (TODO 7)
- Create `HH_pm.py` module
- Implement reinforcement learning optimization for workflow planning
- Develop evolutionary algorithm for task sequencing
- Create performance metrics for plan optimization

### Day 11: Selection Optimization (TODO 8)
- Create `HH_mle.py` module
- Implement reinforcement learning for retrieval method selection
- Develop evolutionary algorithms for model and parameter selection
- Create hyperheuristic evaluation framework

### Day 12: Codebase Optimization (TODO 9)
- Create `HH_swe.py` module
- Implement self-reflection mechanisms for code quality assessment
- Develop evolutionary algorithms for code optimization
- Create code generation and validation system

## Day 13-14: Integration, Testing, and Finalization

### Day 13: Full System Integration
- Integrate all modules into a complete system
- Implement end-to-end workflow testing
- Create system monitoring dashboards
- Develop documentation for the entire system

### Day 14: Final Testing and Deployment
- Conduct system-level testing with real data
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Finalize documentation
- Prepare deployment package and instructions

## Implementation Considerations

### Dependencies and Integration
- The plan accounts for dependencies between components:
  - Knowledge base (dbbuilder.py) needs to be established before retrieval
  - Task planning (planner.py) must be completed before task execution
  - Evaluation (evaluator.py) depends on task execution results

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests for optimization algorithms

### Parallelization Opportunities
- Knowledge base building can be parallelized across documents
- Task execution can be parallelized for independent tasks
- Optimization algorithms can run in parallel with different parameters

### Risk Mitigation
- Early integration testing to identify interface issues
- Regular performance benchmarking to identify bottlenecks
- Version control with frequent commits to track changes
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and error recovery

### Extension Points
- The system is designed to accommodate:
  - New retrieval methods
  - Additional task types
  - Different output formats
  - Alternative optimization algorithms

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the described framework with consideration for software engineering best practices, component dependencies, and optimization opportunities.
